First, planes are much faster, so they save a lot of travel time. Second, planes can reach distant or remote places that trains cannot go to. Third, many people find flying more comfortable and convenient, with better services on board." },

            { question: "Tell me what you see in the two pictures.", duration: 45, sampleAnswer: "These two pictures show different ways people enjoy music. In the first picture on the left, a family is in a cozy room. The mother and daughter are playing the piano together, while the father is playing guitar. In contrast, the second picture shows a lively concert. A musician is singing and playing guitar on stage, with a keyboard player in the background." },
            { question: "Where do you like to play music? Why?", duration: 45, sampleAnswer: "I like to play music in my bedroom because it is a cozy and private space. I can sing along to my favorite songs without worrying about disturbing anyone. I also have a guitar that I like to practice on. Playing music helps me relax and express myself. Sometimes I even write my own songs and record them on my phone." },
            { question: "How does playing music in different locations bring different feelings?", duration: 45, sampleAnswer: "Playing music in different places can create different feelings because each place has its own mood. For example, playing music outside in nature feels relaxing and free. Playing music in a small room feels cozy and personal. Playing music in a crowded place, like a party or concert, feels exciting and energetic because of the people around." }

            { question: "Tell me what you see in the two pictures.", duration: 45, sampleAnswer: "Two pictures show two different places to study. In the first picture, we can see a group of students sitting together in a library. They are smiling and working on a laptop, probably doing a group project. In the second picture, there is a man studying alone in a quiet environment. He is wearing headphones and taking notes, which suggests he is very focused and concentrated." },
            { question: "What are the difficulties when studying in this place?", duration: 45, sampleAnswer: "Studying in a library or a coffee shop can have some challenges. For example, the library might be too quiet and make you feel sleepy or bored. The coffee shop might be too noisy and distract you from your work. You have to find the right balance between silence and stimulation for your study needs." },
            { question: "There is too much noise in our modern lives? Do you agree/ disagree?", duration: 45, sampleAnswer: "I agree that there is too much noise in our modern lives. Noise can come from many sources, such as traffic, construction, music, or people. Noise can affect our health, our mood, and our productivity. It can cause stress, anxiety, and sleep problems. I think we need to find ways to reduce noise pollution and create more quiet spaces for ourselves and others." }
