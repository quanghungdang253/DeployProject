A beautiful park can inspire residents to take up gardening naturally, even without formal workshops. Also, this project will have a lasting impact on future generations.\nI appreciate the effort the City Council is making to encourage gardening and would love to support this initiative in any way I can.

The meetings should be good for both young and older people. I was very happy to hear this, because I think meeting in person is a great way to connect and share.\nFrom my perspective, we should meet on the first Saturday of each month, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. This time is convenient because people usually have free time on weekends, and it is not too early or too late for older members.\nIn addition, I suggest holding the meetings at the community center near the park. It is quiet, easy to reach by bus or car, and has enough space for group activities.\nI hope you will think about my ideas. I look forward to hearing from you.\nVu Khanh Nguyen",
